/*
Problem Description::
You are given a positive number n.
Return the smallest number x greater than or equal to n, such that the binary representation of x contains only set bits.
A set bit refers to a bit in the binary representation of a number that has a value of 1.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: 7
Explanation:
The binary representation of 7 is "111".

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 15
Explanation:
The binary representation of 15 is "1111".

Example 3:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representation of 3 is "11".

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 1000

//Important learnings:
     /*1.Any number which is a power of 2,if we deduct 1 from that number,comes a number where all bits are set!
       2.if (n&(n+1))==0, that means n has all bits sets
       3.To get all bits/totalBitsCount of a number=> log(n)+1,
       now once we get this if we do, 1<<totalNumbersofBits=> giving a number which is power of two, now we can apply point number 1 , we deduct 1 from this, and we get a number which is having all bits set
       4.The difference between two all distinguish set bits numbers are => 2*num+1, where num=1,2,3,..so on
