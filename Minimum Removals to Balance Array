/*
Problem Statement: You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.An array is considered balanced if the value of its maximum element is at most k times the minimum element.
You may remove any number of elements from nums​​​​​​​ without making it empty.Return the minimum number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is balanced.
Note: An array of size 1 is considered balanced as its maximum and minimum are equal, and the condition always holds true.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,5], k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
Remove nums[2] = 5 to get nums = [2, 1].
Now max = 2, min = 1 and max <= min * k as 2 <= 1 * 2. Thus, the answer is 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,6,2,9], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Remove nums[0] = 1 and nums[3] = 9 to get nums = [6, 2].
Now max = 6, min = 2 and max <= min * k as 6 <= 2 * 3. Thus, the answer is 2.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [4,6], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
Since nums is already balanced as 6 <= 4 * 2, no elements need to be removed.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
1 <= k <= 105

    public int minRemoval(int[] nums, int k)

        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int i=0;
        int j=0;
        int n=nums.length;
        int maxArraySize=1; //as size=1 is also a balaanced array
        while(j<n)
        { 
          long max=nums[j];
          long min=nums[i];
          while(i<j && (long)min*k<max)
          {
             i++;
             min=nums[i];
          }
          maxArraySize=Math.max(maxArraySize,j-i+1);
          j++;
        }
        return n-maxArraySize;
    }
}
//TC:O(nlog(n)+2n)~O(nlog(n)+n)
//SC:O(1)
/*
Approach: Wants to find max length of subarray inorder minimize the deletion, so checking with i and j pointer and shrinking(if max>min*k) expanding(min*k>=max) as required, at the end n-maxbalancedLength give us the min deletion number
