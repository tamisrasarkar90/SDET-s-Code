Problem Description: Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
Example 2:
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].

Constraints:
0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

/*
Approach 1: As the limit is 10^9 while we iterate and count number of odd it might gives, TLE as Time complexity is TC:O(10^9-0)~10^9 if it is exceeds 10^8 then it will give TLE
So alternatives is in a range odd numbers are alternatives way means if low and high are both odd then total counts of odd number=(high-low)/2+1; if high and low are even then the next number must be odd hence increase it for low and decrease it for high(previous number must be odd, as we need to calculate till high position)
*/
/*
Approach 2: Not changing value of low and high, will calciulate odd number till low points and odd numbers till high points, so total numbers of odd from high to low is OddNumberTillhighCount-OddNumberTilllowcount
to get oddNumberTillLowCount=low/2(low exclusive) and oddNumberTillHighCount=high+1/2(high inclusive)
