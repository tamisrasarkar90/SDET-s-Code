/*
Problem Description: Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.
Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
"11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.

Example 2:
Input: n = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
"110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
"010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
"011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.
 
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 109

/*
Approach: If there is only 1 set bit in n=> then it will take=>F[i]=2*F[i-1]+1 no of steps
If there is multiple set bits in n then from left to right(in Bit postion the leftmost bit is 32 and then 31,30,29,..0)whatever the set bits is add or subtract to the result alternatively(Incase of n has multiple set bits), that way it can evalute no of steps required to convert n->0
And if n has only 1 set bit whcih is power 2 , then no of steps required F[i-1]*2+1, where F[0]=1(only 1 has 0 th bit set)
