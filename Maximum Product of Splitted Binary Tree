Problem Description: Given the root of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.Return the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 110
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
Output: 90
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 104

/*
Approach: We have to calculate totalSum-leftSubArraySum *leftSubArraySum of which is max, now as it is tree we need to consider the nodes having edge/connected,
Step1: First calculation the totalSum of the tree by traversing root.left and root.right+root.val that will return totalSum in case of Tree
Step2: Calculate the SubTreeSum and then subtract from totalSum and multiply with SubTreeSum in order to get currMaxProduct now updat it with maxProduct aka our result.
To get SubTreeSum, what we have to do is simply, take one node, traverse it's left and right and get the sum  and add root value in it!
Consider the case of example 1: to get Subtree[2,3,4] sum what we have to do is traverse it's left, traverse it's right and add those up with root/node's value that will give you sum of that SubTree, now subtract it from totalSum inorder to get remainingSum now multiply remaining and subTree Sum and get max out of the result
