Problem Description: There exist n rectangles in a 2D plane with edges parallel to the x and y axis. You are given two 2D integer arrays bottomLeft and topRight where bottomLeft[i] = [a_i, b_i] and topRight[i] = [c_i, d_i] represent the bottom-left and top-right coordinates of the ith rectangle, respectively.
You need to find the maximum area of a square that can fit inside the intersecting region of at least two rectangles. Return 0 if such a square does not exist.

Example 1:
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,1]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[6,6]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
A square with side length 1 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 1. It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region of two rectangles.

Example 2:
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[1,3],[1,5]], topRight = [[5,5],[5,7],[5,9]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
A square with side length 2 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 2 * 2 = 4. It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region of two rectangles.

Example 3: 
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[3,4]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
A square with side length 1 can fit inside the intersecting region of any two rectangles. Also, no larger square can, so the maximum area is 1. Note that the region can be formed by the intersection of more than 2 rectangles.

Example 4: 
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[3,3],[3,1]], topRight = [[2,2],[4,4],[4,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No pair of rectangles intersect, hence, the answer is 0.

 

Constraints:

n == bottomLeft.length == topRight.length
2 <= n <= 103
bottomLeft[i].length == topRight[i].length == 2
1 <= bottomLeft[i][0], bottomLeft[i][1] <= 107
1 <= topRight[i][0], topRight[i][1] <= 107
bottomLeft[i][0] < topRight[i][0]
bottomLeft[i][1] < topRight[i][1]

class Solution {
    public long largestSquareArea(int[][] bottomLeft, int[][] topRight) 
    {
       long maxSide=0;
       int n=bottomLeft.length;
       //First will calculate for width i.e x value
       
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
         for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++)
         {
              long width= Math.min(topRight[i][0],topRight[j][0])-Math.max(bottomLeft[i][0],bottomLeft[j][0]);
              long height= Math.min(topRight[i][1],topRight[j][1])-Math.max(bottomLeft[i][1],bottomLeft[j][1]);
              if(width>0 && height>0 )
              {
                 long side=Math.min(width,height);
                 maxSide=Math.max(maxSide,side);
              }
           }
       }
       return maxSide*maxSide;
    }
}
//TC:O(N^2)
//SC:O(1)

/*
Approach: We need to find square/s which are lies in the intersection of rectangles, so to evalute the max area of squares we need to find the intersection's area,i.e height and width, Here we are comparing with two points of individual rectangle bottom left and top right, and will compare with two pairs of rectangles together in order to find intersection area, rest all rectangles which are intersecting might overlap.
In order to find the width of two rectangles intersection, we need to get min of top right of x and max of bottom left of x for both rectangle,Similarly for height we need to get min of y of top right and max of y of bottom left, now will evalute min(width,height) as side to form square, and this side will compare for each pairs of rectangle's intersection, the max side will consider to form area and will return it.
