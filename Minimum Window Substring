/*
Problem Description: Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 

Constraints:
m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
 
Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

Approach: 
Step 1: We need to find t within s but not in order, inorder to check the window of all letters in t, will first store all characters of t within a map,so that search option would take O(1), Now for S will have two pointers i & j,
j will traverse rightwards and if get any char which belongs to map , then in the map count of that char will get decrease and countRequired will get decrease, 
Step 2:Once countRequired is 0 that means we get the require window(Inititally countRequired is equals to t's length) and then we can shrink i
Step 3: While shrinking i will add in map corresponding character's frequency, if any character's frequency is greater than 1 that means our countRequired will gt increase again, and then i will stop and j will start to find that character whose freqency in Map is >0 
Step 4: At each point will keep track of window length and update our result with min len as j-i+1, and the starting index of the window
